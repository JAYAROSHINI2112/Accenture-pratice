You are given a function,

Void *ReplaceCharacter(Char str[], int n, char ch1, char ch2);

The function accepts a string  ‘ str’ of length n and two characters ‘ch1’ and ‘ch2’ as its arguments . Implement the function to modify and return the string ‘ str’ in such a way that all occurrences of ‘ch1’ in original string are replaced by ‘ch2’ and all occurrences of ‘ch2’  in original string are replaced by ‘ch1’.

Assumption: String Contains only lower-case alphabetical letters.

Note:

Return null if string is null.
If both characters are not present in string or both of them are same , then return the string unchanged.
Example:

Input:
Str: apples
ch1:a
ch2:p
Output:
paales
Explanation:

‘A’ in original string is replaced with ‘p’ and ‘p’ in original string is replaced with ‘a’, thus output is paales.

#include <stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    char str[20],c1,c2;
    int i,c=0,len;
    scanf("%s",str);
    len = strlen(str);
    scanf("%s%s",&c1,&c2);
    for(i = 0; i < len; i++)
    {
        if(str[i] == c1)
        {
          str[i] = c2;
        }
        else if(str[i] == c2)
        {
          str[i] = c1;
        }
        else
          c++;
    }
    printf("%s",str);
    return 0;
}
